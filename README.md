 Gatsby + WPGraphQL + Wordpress Blog
</h1>

Gatsby, or GatsbyJS, is a static site generator built with ReactJS and powered by GraphQL. Gatsby allows anyone to create feature-rich, engaging websites and applications. Gatsby fetches data for your site from a variety of sources including existing websites, API calls and flat files through GraphQL, and builds the static site based on configuration settings specified by you.

### Why Gatsby and Wordpress?

It is quite hard to build a modern front-end with WordPress, which meets all the latest tech needs. The main reasons are:
* Updates and Changes
* Deployment and Continuous Integration

On the contrary, Gatsby.js takes care of all these limitations and helps you build a robust front-end, which is not only fast but also modern.
